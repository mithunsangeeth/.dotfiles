# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.

I have created 2 script files known ash linux.sh and cleanup.sh.All the scripts start with shebang. In the file linux.sh i created a new file called linuxsetup.log. Later i created a directory called .TRASH in the home directory if it is not made. Then I declared variables and used the if and else statement for some results. At the end of the file i redirected the file etc/vimrc to .vimrc. Next up was the cleanup.sh file. This script was created to reverse anything that was done in the linux.sh script. The make file was created so that we ran 2 targets that was the linux and clean target. I had to change the permissions for the file.
